## Philosophy

Blogs are great for writing longform curated pieces, but they lack an
incentive for writing small bites of knowledge which are less
time-consuming and more concise. A small writing surface forces you to
get to the point. It also has a much-lower barrier to entry. The hope
is that by enforcing a character limit, you might more readily consider
taking 10 minutes out of your day to sit down and reflect in writing.
